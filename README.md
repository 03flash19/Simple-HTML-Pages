# HacktoberFest-2022
**The biggest open-source festival is back. Let's celebrate and learn. This repository has been made for beginners who are first time contributers in HacktoberFest.**<br/>
<br/>
**Hacktoberfest** is the celebration of Open-Source, its that time of the year when people from all over the world come together to contribute to their favorite Open Source projects. You can get more information about HacktoberFest [here](https://hacktoberfest.com/).
### What to contribute?
You can contribute simple `HTML` and `CSS` based static sites. It need not be anything fancy but plagiarism is a big **NO**


### Contributing Guide
* Star⭐ the repo
* Fork the repo
* Create a branch and name the branch as your GitHub username, example `marshchacha`.
* Then create a folder and name it as your GitHub username. Inside that make separate folders for `HTML`, `CSS`etc. Please include a Readme file describing what your site is all about. If you deploy your static site you can include the link to your site in the readme file itself.
* While opening a PR please add proper description.
* Please follow the folder structure, otherwise your PR will be discarded. An example is present in the repo. Please go through that structure before contributing.
* **Readme changes will be discarded straightaway.**
* **Have patience after opening a PR, unnecessarily tagging the maintainers will lead to marking your PR as spam. If 2 PRs are marked as spam from one user, then they will be Blocked from further contribution to this repo.**
* **If you have any ideas or suggestions, feel free to open an issue by using the appropriate template.**

### Important guidelines about Pull Requests
* If you want to contribute more than one site to this repo, please do it under your main file(i.e. under your GitHub username). Ex - `marshchacha-> site1(HTML_folder, CSS_folder) site2(HTML_folder, CSS_folder)`

**If you have any ideas or suggestions, feel free to open an issue.**

**Please follow all the above guidelines to get your Pull Requests successfully merged and help us to reduce spam.**
<br/>
**Always remember, Hacktoberfest is about making "meaningful contributions" and learning, any kind of SPAM/HATRED is a big NO and WILL NOT BE TOLERATED.**
